  <h1>About</h1>

  <section>
    <p>The Swarthmore College Computer Society (SCCS) is a student-run group 
    offering computing services, tools, toys, and information to the Swarthmore 
    College community. We have a computer lab and video room in Tarble, offer email 
    and web accounts to users and student groups, and periodically host workshops 
    on various topics in technology and computers. Our goal is not to mirror ITS, 
    but to complement and supplement widely available services by providing 
    resources that would otherwise be out of the reach of individuals.</p>

    <p>Our services include physical and electronic resources. For example, you can 
    hang out or work in the Media Lounge, watch movies or play games in the Video 
    Pit, and take photos or make movies with our cameras. Or, from the convenience 
    of anywhere in the world with the internet, you can make your own website, get 
    spam-free email, get l33t with a shell account, and make wikis, databases, and 
    mailing lists for your group.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The SCCS was founded in the Fall of 1991, by a group of Swarthmore
    students. We obtained an official charter from the Budget Committee for the
    Spring, 1992 semester. The SCCS was founded, in part, to support the
    activities of students in Dana and Hallowell who had decided to create an
    Appletalk network by stringing phone cable between rooms. Approximately 32
    Macintoshes on 4 floors (3 in Hallowell, 1 in Dana) were on the network, as
    was one heavy-duty laser printer. Gobs of time was spent diagnosing the
    many network outages that occurred on an almost-daily basis (usually due to
    cables being clamped by window frames) but it was fun. Of course, this was
    two years before the College network came into being...</p>
