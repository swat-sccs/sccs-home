    <h4>Q: Can you install a package for me on Heron?</h4>
    <p>A: Almost definitely! We try to keep Heron (our login server) stocked 
      with everything people want. If you need, for example, a compiler, 
      interpreter, library, or command line tool that we don't have, we're happy 
      to install it for you.
