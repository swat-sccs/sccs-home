title: "Service Outage Update"
---

All SCCS services except the mailing list web interface are back online. We're continuing to work on bringing that web interface back up, and will post a final update here when that happens. The mailing list backend is online; you can still send messages to existing listservs and they'll be distributed normally. If you urgently need to make edits to a mailing list or approve an outgoing message, [email us](mailto:staff@sccs.swarthmore.edu).
