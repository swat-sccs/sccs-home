title: Mailing List Updates
---

SCCS has just upgraded our mailinglist setup. All of your mailinglist information has been preserved, but there are a few small changes to the way the system works. First of all, mailinglists are now located at lists.sccs.swarthmore.edu. Use your SCCS account to login. Even if you did not have an SCCS account before, you will be given appropriate access to any of mailinglists that are associated with your Swarthmore email. 

There are a few changes to the Mailman interface itself. To add new members to a mailinglist you should use the _Mass Subscription_ option under the _Mass Actions_ menu on the list settings page. There are also some changes regarding the difference between a list owner and a list moderator. There may be some actions that were previously available to list moderators that are now only available to list owners. 

If you have any trouble whatsoever with the new system, please email <staff@sccs.swarthmore.edu> and we will sort it out.
